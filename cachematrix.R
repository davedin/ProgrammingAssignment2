## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache 
## its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned
## by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated then
## this function should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
